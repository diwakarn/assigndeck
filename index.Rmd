## Executive Summary

1. Shinayapp - predict weight range  of an american woman in lbs , given the height in inches

2. Uses the women data set in datasets package in R

3. Prediction based on linear regression 

4. Range of weight supplied based on the estimate @95% confidence

## Base Data for the Model 

Women Data set is used for this example 

``` {R}
library(datasets)
head(women,2)

```
This contains height in inches and average weight in lbs

## The Prediction  Model 

A linear regression model l1 is created at the start of the Application
``` {R}
l1 <- lm(weight~ height,data = women)
 l1$coefficients
 
 ```
The prediction function 

p1 <- predict(l1, newdata, interval="predict") 

predicts  the range of weights with the lower and upper ranges 
available from the object p1
